### What are the different OOP patterns you noticed was used in the codebase?

#### Below includes some of the pattern and concepts of Oriented Programming used in the project codebase implemention

- Inheritance: some path from the codebase uses the concepts on inheritance to inherite the states and behavior of the base class.
- Public atributes/methods: most the attributes are public attritute, which can be access and used outside class.
- Static method: which allows us to have a class based method.

## What are the bootlenecks you identified and think we can erradicate to make the system better(In terms of performance, coding styles and codebase structure)?

- The codebase is well structured and understandable!, but I suggest if we could add some feature that enable us to have some of the most important attribute/method privates.
