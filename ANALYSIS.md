### What are the different OOP patterns you noticed was used in the codebase?

#### The below includes some of the pattern and concepts of Object Oriented Programming used in the project codebase implemention requirements.

- Inheritance: some path from the codebase uses the concepts on inheritance to inherite the states and behavior of the base class, having different versions of the base class, let us extends the functionalities.

- Public atributes/methods: most the attributes are public attritute, which can be access and used outside class.

- Static method: This concept were used n our codebase to create class based instance.

## What are the bootlenecks you identified and think we can erradicate to make the system better(In terms of performance, coding styles and codebase structure)?

- The codebase is well structured and understandable!, but I suggest if we could add some feature that enable us to have some of the most important attribute/method privates, I meant using the javaScript provided syntax to implement private attribute and methods in other to add more complexity to our code.
